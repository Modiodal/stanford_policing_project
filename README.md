<h1>Stanford Policing Project</h1>

This was a lesson taken from DataCamp.com. I used my own data set, which allowed me to understand how unique data sets need unique cleaning and assessment. The data was imported from Stanford's "Open Policing" open data which is linked below.Also, print statements have been removed for exploration of the code. To show the graphs simply remove the (#) or comment from the line. 

#A quick note in line 5, you must add your unique UserProfile or computer username for data to appear. 
#Make sure to save the CSV file on your desktop.
